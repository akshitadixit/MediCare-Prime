## Introduction

MediCare is a web application that claims to do the following:
1. Predict various diseases and ailments using machine learning and deep learning by taking in inputs from the user that include their reports, medical images(x-rays, ultrasounds, blood profile, etc)
2. Keep a track of all tests taken by the user and their results, all displayed on a dashboard.
3. Store user's information to analyze the medical history and give health tips and suggestions based on the same.
